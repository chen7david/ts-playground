# Lesson 1: Console, variables, and strings

Hey there, young coder! 👋 Welcome to the TypeScript Playground where we'll have loads of fun learning about coding with TypeScript! 🚀

## What's TypeScript?

Think of TypeScript as your magical language that helps you talk to computers and make them do cool things! It's like casting spells but with words and symbols. ✨

## Console.log 🖨️

Imagine a magical box called the console. When you say `console.log()`, you're telling the computer to shout out whatever you want inside that box! 📦🔊 For example:

```typescript
console.log('Hello, magical world!')
```

## Variables: Const and Let 🎩

Variables are like magic potions. They help you store information! 💫 We have two types of potions: `const` and `let`.

### Const Potion 🌟

The `const` potion is like a spell that sets something in stone. Once you mix it, you can't change it! 🚫 For example:

```typescript
const age = 10 // My age is always 10! 🎂
```

### Let Potion 🌈

The `let` potion is more flexible. You can change what's inside whenever you want! It's like having a bag that you can swap stuff in and out of. 🎒 For example:

```typescript
let cookies = 5 // Yum! 5 cookies for me 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪
cookies = 10 // Oops, now I have 10 cookies! 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪
```

## Strings: "", '', and `` 🧵

Strings are like magical words or messages. We have three kinds of magic symbols to wrap our strings in: "", '', and ``.

### Double Quotes " " 🎈

Double quotes are like putting words in a balloon. They hold everything together! 🎈 For example:

```typescript
const name = 'Sorcerer' // My name is "Sorcerer"!
```

### Single Quotes ' ' 🧸

Single quotes are like cuddling your words. They keep them warm and cozy! 🧸 For example:

```typescript
const animal = 'dragon' // My favorite animal is 'dragon'! 🐉
```

### Backticks ` ` 🎉

Backticks are like throwing a party for your words! They can do tricks and invite other things to join! 🎉 For example:

```typescript
const greeting = `Hi there, ${name}!` // Hi there, Sorcerer!
```

## The Great Let vs Const Debate 🤔

So, why do we have both `let` and `const`? It's like choosing between a magical artifact and a potion! `const` is for things that never change, like the North Star 🌟, while `let` is for things that might change, like the weather! 🌧️

## Let's Play! 🎉

Now that we've learned some magical spells, it's time to practice! Here are some fun exercises for you:

1. **Cookie Counting:** Use `let` to keep track of how many cookies you eat each day!
2. **Magical Messages:** Experiment with different types of strings to send messages to your friends or favorite mythical creatures! 🧙‍♂️🧚‍♀️
3. **Console Fun:** Try out `console.log()` to create a secret code or a silly story!

Remember, coding is all about creativity and fun! So grab your wand (or keyboard) and let's make some magic together! ✨

Happy coding! 🚀
